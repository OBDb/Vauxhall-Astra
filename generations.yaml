    description: "The Vauxhall Astra Mark 1 was the UK-badged version of the Opel Kadett D, launched in March 1980 as Vauxhall's first front-wheel drive model, replacing the Viva. Initially offered in hatchback, saloon, and estate body styles, with engines ranging from 1.2 to 1.8 liters including the fuel-injected GTE introduced in 1983. This generation established Vauxhall's entry into the competitive small family car segment, competing against the Ford Escort and Volkswagen Golf. The 1.8 GTE became a notable hot hatch rival to the Ford XR3i and Golf GTI, featuring the first 'colour-coded' body trim in the UK. Awarded What Car?'s Car of the Year for 1980."

    description: "The Vauxhall Astra Mark 2, launched on 17 October 1984, featured completely restyled aerodynamics while sharing the previous generation's engines and running gear. This long-lived generation was available in hatchback, estate, saloon (badged as Vauxhall Belmont), and cabriolet versions, with Bertone building 6,764 convertibles between 1987-1993. The Mark 2 was voted 1985 European Car of the Year. Performance variants included the GTE with 1.8 and 2.0-liter engines, culminating in the legendary 20XE 'red top' twin-cam engine producing approximately 150 bhp. The special edition GTE 'Leather Edition' launched in 1990 featured Recaro seats and Connolly leather interior. The Mark 2 became Britain's second most popular small family car, though it never matched the Ford Escort's sales success."

    description: "The Vauxhall Astra Mark 3, released in October 1991, was the first generation sold as Astra by Opel (succeeding the Kadett E) and also by Holden in Australia and New Zealand. Available as three or five-door hatchback, saloon, estate, and cabriolet (Bertone-built), this generation introduced significant safety improvements including twin side impact bars, collapsible steering column, and pre-tensioner seatbelts—ahead of competitors like the Volkswagen Golf and Ford Monde. The range was revised in late 1994 with new Ecotec engines and subtle exterior styling updates including Vauxhall's corporate 'V' grille. The top performance model was the three-door only GSi with 1.8 or 2.0 16v engines, later replaced by Sport models with Lotus suspension. Trim levels included Merit, LS, GLS, CD, CDX, Si, SRi, and special editions such as Sport, Expression, California, and Arizona."

    description: "The Vauxhall Astra Mark 6 (codenamed J), officially unveiled at the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show and available from late 2009, was designed under GM's Australian subsidiary with significant influence from the Vauxhall Insignia's design language. The main manufacturing plant at Ellesmere Port benefited from sterling depreciation. Available as five-door hatchback and estate (Sports Tourer, debuted Paris Motor Show 2010), the Mark 6 was a strong sales success—Britain's best-selling car in June 2010 with over 10,000 sales, outselling the Ford Focus by nearly 50%. The model served as BBC2 Top Gear's 'Reasonably Priced Car' in the Tech Line trim. Engine options included efficient petrol and diesel units, with the 1.0-liter three-cylinder engine introduced later in the generation. The 'OnStar' system provided integrated assistance calling. The sixth generation was Britain's second-best selling new car in 2010 with 80,646 units, finally outselling the Ford Focus and ending Ford's 37-year lead in the small family car segment."
